                Hello, and welcome to my version of the Todo-List project for The Odin Project.
                Some things about my project may be confusing, so I wish to clear that up and maybe
                I'll make future changes to make it easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sidenote when scrolling through a lengthy task and there are many tasks that add scroll to the
                container: It is best to leave your mouse on the left side of the task, where all the text is, when
                scrolling to actually scroll the div instead of the entire container.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start, when you are on the homepage, you are creating tasks that are <strong>Independent</strong>
                of a project. This means they are not associated with a project. You can also create tasks in the today
                and week tabs, but for now, when creating tasks in either week or today pages, keep in mind that it will throw you back to the homePage.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to create a project, youcan click the plus next to the list item "Projects" which will direct you to a 
                dialog to fill out info about the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create tasks <em>for</em> a project, click on the project in the list on the left that you wish to add a task
                to, and click the plus at the bottom as if you were creating a task not related to a project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, to create notes, click on the "Notes" tab in the list and click the plus on the bottom of the list, which will
                bring up a dialog for creating a note.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's all. I hope this helps to some incase the structure of my UI is not laid out obviously. Hope you enjoy the use of my project!
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me know of any bugs btw that I might have missed. I haven't done a true deep testing of the application so feedback is appreciated!
